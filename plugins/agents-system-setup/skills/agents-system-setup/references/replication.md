# Replication — Bidirectional Porting Across Runtimes

This skill can replicate an agent system from one runtime to another (and back) without manual rewrites. The strategy is **Canonical IR (Intermediate Representation) → emit per platform**, not N×N pairwise mappings.

> Supported runtimes: **Copilot CLI**, **Claude Code**, **OpenCode**, **OpenAI Codex (CLI + App)**, and **Gemini CLI**.
>
> Runtime drift and advanced/import-only surfaces are tracked in [runtime-updates](./runtime-updates.md).

## 1. Canonical IR

Every agent, skill, and MCP server is parsed into a single in-memory record. Every emitter renders from this — never from another platform's serialized form.

For generated output, apply [context optimization](./context-optimization.md): preserve IR fidelity, but render compact governance summaries inline and link overflow details when the selected profile is `Balanced` or `Compact`.

> Replication preserves explicit `model:` overrides only. When the source agent left `model:` blank, emit `model: inherit` (or omit it where the target runtime treats absence as inherit). Never invent ids — see [models](./models.md) for accepted formats per target.
>
> **Task Assignment preservation:** replication preserves the full Task Assignment Contract structure ([handoff.md](./handoff.md#delegation-packet-canonical-schema)). Required-minimum fields are 1:1 across runtimes; expansion blocks (Goal & Definition of Done, Scope, File Inventory, Verification Protocol, Reporting Protocol, etc.) must be carried into the target agent body. Codex TOML keeps the structure inside `developer_instructions`; never silently drop expansion blocks during replication. Surface any drop in the lossiness report.

### Tool-name canonicalization

| IR canonical | Copilot CLI | Claude Code | OpenCode | Gemini CLI |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `read` | `read` (compatible: `view`, `Read`) | `Read` | `read` | `read_file` |
| `write` | `edit` (compatible: `Write`) | `Write` | `write` | runtime-discovered write tool; warn if unknown |
| `edit` | `edit` | `Edit` | `edit` | runtime-discovered edit tool; warn if unknown |
| `bash` | `execute` (compatible: `shell`, `Bash`, `powershell`) | `Bash` | `bash` | `run_shell_command` |
| `grep` | `search` (compatible: `Grep`) | `Grep` | `grep` | `grep_search` |
| `glob` | `search` (compatible: `Glob`) | `Glob` | `glob` | runtime-discovered glob/search tool; warn if unknown |
| `webfetch` | `web` | `WebFetch` | `webfetch` | runtime-discovered web tool or MCP tool; warn if unknown |
| `task` | `agent` (compatible: `custom-agent`, `Task`) | `Agent` | `task` | n/a inside subagents; root can use `@<agent>` / subagent tools |
| `vscode_host` (chat-host integration) | `vscode` (Copilot CLI ignores unknown tools harmlessly per docs; safe baseline) | n/a — drop with warning ❌ | n/a — drop with warning ❌ | n/a — drop with warning ❌ |

The IR uses the lowercase canonical names. Renderers translate **at emit time only** — never round-trip through another platform's name set.

#### Copilot CLI tool fill rule (replication target)

When emitting Copilot CLI from IR:

1. If the source AgentIR has an explicit non-empty `tools:` set, translate via the canonicalization table and pass through.
2. Otherwise, fill `tools:` from the role-derived [Standard Tool Profile](./platforms.md#copilot-cli-standard-tool-profiles): `standard` for orchestrator/edit-capable, `read-only` for reviewers/auditors, `runner` for testers/release, `research` for docs/research, `inherit` only when the user explicitly opted out (Q9c).
3. Always include `vscode` in the `standard` profile (safe — unrecognized aliases are ignored on non-VS-Code surfaces).
4. Surface the chosen profile in the lossiness report; record the marker `<!-- agents-system-setup:tools-profile: <profile> -->` in the emitted file body header.

### Codex CLI + App compatibility rule

When Codex is a target, replication emits shared Codex artifacts, not CLI-only behavior: `AGENTS.md` for project/orchestrator memory, `.codex/agents/<name>.toml` for specialized custom agents, and `.codex/config.toml` for `[agents]` defaults. CLI commands such as `/agent`, `/plugins`, and `codex exec` may appear in "Try it" notes, but the replicated TOML must work without relying on those commands as required App behavior.

### Gemini CLI support rule

Gemini CLI is a supported local-subagent target. Replication emits `.gemini/agents/<name>.md` with `kind: local`, loader-valid `mcp_servers:`, and Markdown body prompts. It must report lossiness for recursive delegation (Gemini subagents cannot call subagents), remote A2A fields (`kind: remote`, `agent_card_url`, `agent_card_json`, `auth`; import/advanced only), and any tool names that cannot be mapped to Gemini's runtime-discovered tool registry.

## 3. Replication Procedure

Triggered when the user picks **mode: `replicate`** in Phase 1, or when Phase 1 detects two+ runtime footprints and the user confirms a port.

```
1. SOURCE pick:    ask_user "Which runtime is the source of truth?"
2. TARGETS pick:   ask_user "Which runtime(s) should I replicate to?"
                   (multi-select, source excluded)
3. PARSE source files  → AgentIR / SkillIR / MCPServerIR records (in memory)
4. NORMALIZE          → canonical tool names, expand `tools: omitted` to all-true
5. LOSSINESS REPORT   → for each (target × IR field), flag: kept | mapped | dropped
                         Render a compact table; ask_user approval per dropped field.
                         Link overflow details if the table exceeds the chosen profile.
                        Also flag surface lossiness, such as source CLI-only usage
                        instructions that must not become required Codex App behavior.
6. MCP APPROVAL GATE  → re-run Phase 3.5 against any MCPServerIR that will be
                        emitted into a target the user hasn't approved before.
7. EMIT per target    → write per-platform paths + frontmatter/TOML (platforms.md)
                        with `<!-- agents-system-setup:replicated-from: <source> -->`
                        marker just under the frontmatter.
8. WRITE ledger       → append one JSON object per line to
                        `.agents-system-setup/replication.jsonl` at the repo root.
                        **NEVER** place the ledger inside any agents/ directory
                        (`.claude/agents/`, `.codex/agents/`, `.opencode/agents/`,
                        `.github/agents/`) and **NEVER** use a `.md` extension —
                        agent loaders walk those trees by extension and will
                        treat the file as a malformed agent.
                        Each line:
                        `{"ts":"<ISO8601>","source":"<runtime>","targets":["..."],
                         "files":[{"path":"...","sha256":"..."}]}`
9. VERIFY round-trip  → re-parse the emitted files back to IR; assert structural
                        equality on (name, description, tools-canonical, mcp_refs,
                        governance metadata that the target can represent).
                        Surface any drift.
```

## 4. Improve Mode (audit + targeted upgrade)

Different from `update` (which re-runs the generator) and `replicate` (which copies across runtimes).

```
1. DETECT current footprint (which runtimes; which artifacts present).
2. AUDIT each artifact against per-platform schema (frontmatter validity,
   description quality, tool minimization, `name`↔filename match, MCP gate
   compliance, Directory Architecture coverage) and the governance baseline:
   Security & Audit Matrix, Threat Model, Architecture / Design Pattern Matrix,
   ADR plan, Quality Gates, least-privilege tool boundaries, secrets handling,
   dependency/supply-chain provenance, and source-backed recommendations.
3. SCORE: assign each artifact and governance category one of
   {ok, warn, fail, requires-human} with reasons.
4. PROPOSE deltas as a checklist. For each item show: file, issue, suggested
   fix, blast radius, source reference, and evidence required. ask_user
   multi-select which to apply.
5. APPLY only the approved deltas, with .bak backups (Phase 5 mechanics).
6. SUMMARY: applied / skipped / requires-human counts.
```

Common improve targets:
- Subagent `description` lacks trigger keywords → re-write with concrete verbs.
- `tools:` omitted on a read-only agent → restrict to read+grep+glob.
- MCP server in `.mcp.json` not referenced by any agent → flag for removal.
- `AGENTS.md` missing Directory Architecture or Capability Matrix → regenerate sections inside managed block.
- `AGENTS.md` missing Context Loading Policy, Security & Audit Matrix, Threat Model, Architecture / Design Pattern Matrix, ADR Index, or Quality Gates → regenerate sections inside managed block.
- Agent can write secrets/MCP/CI/release/dependency paths without a security owner → downgrade tools or require orchestrator/security review.
- Plugin/MCP/skill recommendation has no source URL or untrusted source → remove or replace with a tiered marketplace candidate.
- Design-pattern guidance is absent or contradictory → add architecture reviewer delta and ADR plan.
- New marketplace plugin/skill exists for an installed capability (compare against [marketplaces.md](./marketplaces.md)) — surface as opt-in upgrade.

## 5. Anti-patterns

- **Pairwise mappings.** Never write a "copilot→claude" function. Always go through IR.
- **Silent field drops.** A `permission.bash` block with deny patterns must produce a visible warning when emitting Copilot/Claude/Codex (which can't enforce it).
- **Tool-name pass-through.** Writing Claude's `Read` into a Copilot agent (or vice-versa) breaks discovery silently.
- **Replicating without MCP gate.** Replication must re-trigger the MCP approval gate for any new target.
- **Writing Gemini docs spelling blindly.** `mcpServers` appears in upstream prose, but generated local Gemini agents must use loader-valid `mcp_servers:`.
- **Recursive Gemini workers.** Gemini subagents cannot invoke other subagents; root/orchestrator must own fan-out.
- **Skipping the round-trip verify.** A successful emit isn't success — re-parse and diff IR.
- **Markdown-format replication ledger inside an agents/ directory.** A `.md` file named like `agent-replication.md` placed in `.claude/agents/`, `.codex/agents/`, `.opencode/agents/`, or `.github/agents/` will be parsed as a malformed agent by the runtime and either silently ignored *or* corrupt the agent list. Always write the ledger as `.agents-system-setup/replication.jsonl` (JSON Lines, never `.md`, never inside an agents tree). Same rule applies to any other operational log this skill writes.
- **Dropping governance metadata silently.** Security controls, audit requirements, architecture decisions, quality gates, and sensitive paths must either round-trip or appear in the lossiness report.
