# Changelog

All notable changes to this plugin are documented here. Format: [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com).

## [0.2.3] - 2026-04-22

### Added

- README badges: CI status, Release status, latest release version, MIT license, cross-OS, supported runtimes.

### Changed

- **GitHub Actions bumped to current majors** (via Dependabot PRs #1–#4):
  - `actions/checkout` v4 → v6
  - `actions/setup-python` v5 → v6
  - `softprops/action-gh-release` v2 → v3
  - `DavidAnson/markdownlint-cli2-action` v16 → v23 (ships markdownlint v0.40)
- Trimmed `SKILL.md` description from ~1.6 KB to 936 chars to satisfy the 1024-char skill-description limit.

### Fixed

- `.markdownlint.yaml`: disable MD051 (link-fragments) and MD060 (table-column-style) — new defaults in markdownlint v0.40 that produce only cosmetic noise.
- README Runtimes badge anchor: `#install` → `#install--per-runtime` to match the actual heading slug.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-04-22

### Added

- **Phase 1.7 — Domain Detection & Spec-Kit recommendation.** When the project brief matches a software-development keyword set or shows source-language signals, the skill now offers to install [GitHub Spec-Kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit) for the chosen runtime (`copilot`, `claude`, `codex`, `opencode`).
- New reference doc `skills/agents-system-setup/references/spec-kit.md` covering positioning, install commands, and the `/specify` → `/plan` → `/tasks` → `/implement` workflow.
- New asset `skills/agents-system-setup/assets/spec-kit-block.snippet.md` — managed `AGENTS.md` block that documents the Spec-Driven workflow when Spec-Kit is opted in.
- Hard Rule #14: Spec-Kit recommendation is opt-in only and scoped to software-dev domains.

### Changed

- `assets/AGENTS.md.template` now has a `{{SPEC_KIT_BLOCK}}` placeholder rendered conditionally by Phase 4.
- `.markdownlint.yaml` disables MD012 so changelog stubs don't break the lint job.
- `scripts/_bump_version.py` tightens stub spacing to keep markdownlint green.

### Fixed

- CHANGELOG header had a stray blank line that tripped MD012 on CI.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-04-22

### Added

- Cross-OS CI matrix (Ubuntu / macOS / Windows) running validators, ShellCheck, PSScriptAnalyzer, and markdownlint on every push and PR.
- Tag-driven release workflow that publishes a tarball + SHA-256 to GitHub Releases when a `v*.*.*` tag is pushed.
- JSON Schemas for all four runtime manifests under `schemas/`.
- `scripts/validate.{sh,ps1}` — cross-platform validator (manifest schema, version sync across all four manifests, frontmatter checks, encoding, internal link resolution).
- `scripts/bump-version.{sh,ps1}` — atomic version bump across the four manifests + CHANGELOG stub generator.
- `.github/dependabot.yml` for weekly GitHub Actions updates.
- `SECURITY.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, issue/PR templates, `.editorconfig`, `.markdownlint.yaml`.

### Changed

- Repository is now public so Actions runs on free-tier minutes.

### Fixed

- Validator now uses POSIX paths internally so dict lookups work on Windows.
- Validator output is ASCII + UTF-8 stdout to avoid Windows cp1252 `UnicodeEncodeError`.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-04-22

### Added
- **Native plugin manifests for Claude Code (`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`) and Codex CLI (`.codex-plugin/plugin.json` + `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`)** — one-line install on both runtimes.
- **OpenCode install scripts** (`scripts/install-opencode.{sh,ps1}`) — clone-and-copy install for the runtime that doesn't support skill-bundle plugins natively.
- **Parallelism reference** (`skills/agents-system-setup/references/parallelism.md`) — defines parallel subagents vs Claude Code agent teams, parallel-safety derivation from Directory Architecture, wave-based execution, and per-runtime orchestrator prompt patterns.
- **Hard rule #13**: parallelism is mandatory where work is independent. Sequential-only topologies are an error.
- **Wave plan** in Phase 2 output and Agent Roster (`parallel-safe`, `wave` columns).
- **`AGENT-TEAMS.md` emission** for Claude Code projects when 3+ subagents are team-suitable.

### Changed
- Bumped version to 0.2.0.
- README rewritten with per-runtime install commands cross-referenced against vendor docs.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-04-22

Initial public release.

### Added
- Skill `agents-system-setup` with four modes: `init`, `update`, `improve`, `replicate`.
- Multi-runtime support: GitHub Copilot CLI, Claude Code, OpenCode, OpenAI Codex CLI.
- Canonical IR for bidirectional agent/skill/MCP replication across runtimes.
- Marketplace-first plugin/MCP discovery with vendor attribution.
- Mandatory MCP approval gate; per-item opt-in for all recommendations.
- Cross-OS scripts (`.sh` + `.ps1`) and `.gitattributes` for line-ending safety.
- DESIGN.md documenting reasoning behind every phase and hard rule.
